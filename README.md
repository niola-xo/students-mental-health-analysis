# students-mental-health-analysis

##  In this project, we'll perform exploratory data analysis on a dataset around mental health of domestic and international students. We'll perform SQL querying to look at how social connectedness and cultural issues affect mental health. Finally, we'll visualize the results of the analysis using the Python Plotly package.

The visual of the full analysis is available [here](|https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1-0VPE3ur2niouyHooDaGrKHfcF_V2Gd7?authuser=0#scrollTo=AAdwinXFg-2N) on Google Colab
